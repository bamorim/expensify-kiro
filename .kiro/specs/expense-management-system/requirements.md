# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Expensify expense management system is a smart, policy-driven platform that helps organizations streamline employee expense reimbursements. The system supports multiple organizations with role-based access control, automated policy enforcement, and approval workflows. The primary goal is to reduce expense processing time from 7 days to under 2 days while achieving 95% policy compliance and 70% auto-approval rates.
